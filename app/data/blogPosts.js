        <p>In Nigeria, the agricultural supply chain has long been plagued by inefficiencies, waste, and limited market access for smallholder farmers. These challenges have contributed to food insecurity, economic losses, and missed opportunities for growth in the agricultural sector.</p>
        
        <h2>The Traditional Agricultural Supply Chain in Nigeria</h2>
        
        <p>The traditional agricultural supply chain in Nigeria typically involves multiple intermediaries between farmers and consumers. This lengthy chain often results in:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>High post-harvest losses (estimated at 50-60% for perishable produce)</li>
          <li>Price inflation as each intermediary adds their markup</li>
          <li>Reduced farmer income as they receive only a small fraction of the final selling price</li>
          <li>Limited market information for farmers, leading to poor decision-making</li>
          <li>Inconsistent quality and availability of produce for consumers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Bayangida Farms: A Revolutionary Approach</h2>

        <p>Nigeria, often referred to as the "Giant of Africa," boasts a rich agricultural heritage and diverse agroecological zones that support the cultivation of various crops. Agriculture remains a cornerstone of Nigeria's economy, employing approximately 70% of the country's labor force and contributing significantly to its GDP.</p>
        
        <p>In this blog post, we'll explore the top five crops grown in Nigeria and how Bayangida Farms is working to support the farmers who cultivate these essential crops.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Cassava</h2>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Yam</h2>
        
        <p>Nigeria produces over 45 million tonnes of yam annually, making it the world's largest producer. Yam is not just a food crop but also holds cultural significance in many Nigerian communities, particularly in the eastern and middle belt regions.</p>
